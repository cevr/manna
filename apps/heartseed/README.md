# Heartseed

Scripture memorization on One (React Native on iOS, react-native-web on the
web). Today (`app/index.tsx`) shows the passage the reader is learning; the
word matcher (`src/matcher.ts`) grades a recall against the verse.

Run it as a reader does with the verify skill,
`.claude/skills/verify-heartseed`. It drives through `bun run sim`
(`scripts/sim.ts`): the shared simulator driver `@manna/sim` with
Heartseed's values, `scripts/sim-app.ts` (the `verify-heartseed`
simulator, ports 8280-8289, iOS alone).

## Voice

The voice reads a verse aloud on the device and lights each word as it is
spoken; the reader can turn it off. No screen calls it yet: the hear phase
will call `Voice.read`.

- `src/voice.ts` is the `Voice` service (Effect): `read`, `pause`,
  `resume`, `stop`, `setEnabled`, and the `view` a screen shows (`status`,
  the `verse`, its `words`, how many are `lit`, the `current` word range and
  how the reading `ended`), with its `changes`: a new subscriber starts at
  the current view, and one held up keeps only the last 16, so it always
  reaches the latest and never holds the history. Its rules are a pure reducer,
  `src/voice/reading.ts`: a command changes the view at its call, then makes
  its one source call, so no command waits on another's; an event changes
  the view only for the current utterance while a reading is under way, and
  a range lights the words it overlaps, never fewer than are lit. A word is
  one the matcher counts (`src/matcher/words.ts`), found by its UTF-16 span.
- The switch is kept under `heartseed/voice/enabled` in the app's settings
  store, `src/store.ts` (One's key-value store, or memory where it cannot
  open). Only the text `false` turns it off; a failed read or write is
  logged and never fails the service. `setEnabled` writes the switch while
  its stop is under way, not after it, one write at a time, each the
  switch the view holds then, so the store ends at the last call's switch
  however the stops settle.
- `src/voice/source.ios.ts` is the source on iOS: the Swift package
  `native/voice` over AVSpeechSynthesizer, which One's prebuild makes the
  local pod `OneSwiftPackages/voice`. Its voices and its events cross as the
  Codable structs `VoiceInfo` and `VoiceEvent`; the module's declaration
  (`native/voice/Voice.d.swift.ts`) is committed as One writes it, which
  neither the formatter nor the lint touches. `src/voice/source.ts` is every
  other platform's: no voices, and a speak that fails, so a reading ends
  `failed`.
- The module emits events only for the utterance it holds; one that JS
  stopped or replaced emits nothing more, so a late event cannot reach a
  reading that came after it, even across a JS reload, which restarts the
  ids at 1. It leaves the audio session alone and ends the held utterance
  on an interruption.
- On the simulator the voice makes no sound: the module never speaks there.
  It renders the utterance to buffers it drops, logs
  `[voice] speak utterance=<n> skipped=simulator`, and sends the render's
  word markers at their sample times, so the words light at the pace they
  would be heard. `src/voice/guard.test.ts` holds the Swift file to this.

## Tests

- The unit tests (`*.test.ts(x)`, not `*.slow.test.*`) run as parts, each a
  package script and a task of `turbo.json` that the commandless `test` task
  depends on, so the gate runs each as its own task and
  `bun run test:budget @manna/heartseed` times each alone (under 1 s). The
  `src` parts run with `src/test/setup.ts` as the preload (react-native-web
  for `react-native`, the bundled passage for `virtual:heartseed-passage`, a
  happy-dom document); `test:infra` runs with none.
  - `test:matcher`: `src/matcher.property.test.ts`, the matcher's generated
    recalls.
  - `test:voice`: `src/voice.property.test.ts` (the voice against its model)
    and `src/voice` (the native module's guards).
  - `test:rest`: the other test files at the root of `src`, named file by
    file.
  - `test:infra`: `scripts` and `vite`, with `scripts/sim.test.ts`
    (Heartseed's `sim` over a stand-in Drive: its values, the web and a
    port outside 8280-8289 refused before any step, and `install` waiting
    for Today's reference).

  Run one with `bun run test:<part>` here, or all with `bun run test
  --filter=@manna/heartseed` at the repository root. A new test file at the
  root of `src` must be named in a part. `scripts/parts.test.ts` holds the
  parts to the files on disk: each unit-test file runs in exactly one part,
  no part takes a slow file, and `src` runs under the preload. A part's
  turbo inputs leave out the other parts' test files, never their sources,
  so an edit of one part's test reruns that part, plus `test:rest` and
  `test:infra`: `test:rest` holds `core-import.test.ts`, which reads every
  `src` file, and `test:infra` holds `parts.test.ts`.
