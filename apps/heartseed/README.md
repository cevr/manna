# Heartseed

Scripture memorization on One (React Native on iOS, react-native-web on the
web). Today (`app/index.tsx`) shows the passage the reader is learning; the
word matcher (`src/matcher.ts`) grades a recall against the verse.

Run it as a reader does with the verify skill,
`.claude/skills/verify-heartseed`.

## Tests

- The unit tests (`*.test.ts(x)`, not `*.slow.test.*`) run as parts, each a
  package script and a task of `turbo.json` that the commandless `test` task
  depends on, so the gate runs each as its own task and
  `bun run test:budget @manna/heartseed` times each alone (under 1 s). The
  `src` parts run with `src/test/setup.ts` as the preload (react-native-web
  for `react-native`, the bundled passage for `virtual:heartseed-passage`, a
  happy-dom document); `test:infra` runs with none.
  - `test:matcher`: `src/matcher.property.test.ts`, the matcher's generated
    recalls.
  - `test:rest`: the other test files at the root of `src`, named file by
    file.
  - `test:infra`: `scripts` and `vite`.

  Run one with `bun run test:<part>` here, or all with `bun run test
  --filter=@manna/heartseed` at the repository root. A new test file at the
  root of `src` must be named in a part. `scripts/parts.test.ts` holds the
  parts to the files on disk: each unit-test file runs in exactly one part,
  no part takes a slow file, and `src` runs under the preload. A part's
  turbo inputs leave out the other parts' test files, never their sources,
  so an edit of one part's test reruns that part, plus `test:rest` and
  `test:infra`: `test:rest` holds `core-import.test.ts`, which reads every
  `src` file, and `test:infra` holds `parts.test.ts`.
